ActsAsSanitize
=============

This +acts_as+ extension provides the capabilities of sanitizing model
attributes, in order to keep your database clean.

Example

 class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_sanitize :title, :body, :on => :save
 end
 
The Post model will then sanitize the :title and :body columns on
before_save.
